### Competitor Analysis Script

#### Description:
This Python script provides a comprehensive analysis of the competitors' relevance against organic traffic. The script primarily focuses on visualizing the data and identifying potential outliers.

#### Key Features:
1. **Data Loading and Overview**: Loads a dataset that contains information about competitors' relevance and organic traffic and provides a quick overview of the data.
2. **Data Visualization**: Creates a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between competitor relevance and organic traffic.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Uses Z-score calculations to detect potential outliers in the organic traffic data.
4. **Data Export**: Saves the processed dataset, including calculated z-scores, into a new CSV file for further analysis.


#### Potential Enhancements:
- Incorporation of additional outlier detection methods.
- Enhanced visualizations, such as histograms or box plots.
- Advanced statistical analysis to derive more insights from the data.
