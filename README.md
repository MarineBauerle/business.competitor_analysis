##### Data

The `data` folder is divided into `raw` and `processed` sub-folders:
- `raw`: Contains the initial dataset on Binance and its competitors.
- `processed`: Contains the cleaned and processed data used for the visualizations.

##### Script

- `binance.py`: This script contains the Python code used for data processing and cleaning.

##### Documents

Refer to the [dashboard_info.md](./documents/dashboard_info.md) for insights into the Tableau dashboard visualizations and the [Binance Competitor Analysis Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/BinanceCompetitorAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=fr-FR&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).



### Methodology (For `dashboard_info.md`)


For this analysis, the methodology is outlined as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Data was sourced from SEMRUSH analytics tool that provides insights into website performance and competitive metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Using the `binance.py` script, the raw data was cleaned by removing any missing values, normalizing inconsistent data points, and aggregating metrics as needed.

3. **Data Analysis**: 
    - **Organic Traffic Analysis**: Assessed the volume of organic traffic competitors receive, giving insights into their search engine performance.
    - **Keyword Analysis**: Evaluated the common keywords that Binance and its competitors rank for, providing a perspective on the content strategy.
    - **AdWords Usage**: Analyzed the extent to which competitors use paid advertising to drive traffic to their sites.
    - **Relevance Analysis**: Mapped organic traffic against different metrics (like common keywords and AdWords) to gauge the relevance and performance of competitors in the market.

4. **Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations using Tableau, enabling stakeholders to dynamically explore the competitive landscape and make informed decisions.

The combination of data analysis and visualization allows for a holistic understanding of Binance's positioning among its competitors and highlights areas of opportunity or concern.
